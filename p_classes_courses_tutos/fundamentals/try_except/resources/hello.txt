Hi, My name is Cristopher! 

And I'm here learning Python
It seems to be easy but sometimes it gets complicate,
however, I continue trying to learn everything about 
the lenguague and discovering new tecniques I haven't
implemented in my previous codes. 

Without more to say, I'll continue achiving my goals
to finaly be proud of what I will be able to create
in the future.
